# Linked List Data Structure

In linked list we store items using pointers. Each item points to the next item. 

## Arrays vs Linked Lists
In arrays we store items in contiguous memory location, and hence OS must to fit array items literally near each other. When we use linked lists OS doesn't need to try to fit every item nearby, because in linked lists we use references to point out where to find items.

That's why when you define an array you define its size immediately, and then, after you created an array you can not change original array's size.
