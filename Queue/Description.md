# The queue that uses doubly-linked list internanlly.

The queue data structue satisfies the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. This implementation implements the IQueue contract, and uses the doubly-linked list.

Basic operations and their time complexity is shown in the next table.

| Operation type | Time Complexity |
|:--------------:|:---------------:|
| Enqueuing an item | O(1) |
| Dequeuing an item | O(1) |
