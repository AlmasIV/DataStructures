# Binary Trees

The first node is called the root node. Every node can be a parent node, or a leaf node.

An empty tree is also can be considered as a binary tree.

Any node can have left or right child nodes.

Internal nodes are nodes between the root node and leaf nodes.

## Characteristics

Binary trees have these characteristics:

1. A node can have maximum two children.
2. From root to any node, there must exist only one path to reach that node.
3. There exists only one root.
